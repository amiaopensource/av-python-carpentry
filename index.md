Python is often referred to as the “swiss army knife” of computer programming languages, capable of meeting the needs of nearly any task with its characteristic ease-of-use, simplicity, and efficiency.
In this half-day workshop, Nick Krabbenhoeft and Ben Turkus, two members of NYPL’s Research Libraries, will go full Leatherman, introducing participants to all of the ways  Python can have a transformative effect on media digitization workflows. 

Designed for archivists working with digital media collections of any size, this will be a practical and skills-oriented effort, offering participants a thorough grounding in Python basics and an introduction to a number of Python tools that allow for the general manipulation and analysis of media.
Specific modules/libraries/tools will include: the os, glob, re, subprocess, shutil, csv and json modules; FFmpeg; pymediainfo/MediaConch; pandas; matplotlib; and seaborn.

title: "Code of Conduct"
---
As contributors, maintainers, and facilitators of this project,
we pledge to follow the [AMIA Code of Conduct][coc].

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by following the AMIA reporting guidelines in the Code of Conduct.
Reports can be made to staff or anonymously via the [reporting form][coc-reporting].

This workshop also uses the Recurse Center's [Social Rules][social-rules]:
* No well-actually’s
* No feigned surprise
* No backseat driving
* No subtle -isms

These are separate from the AMIA Code of Conduct. "These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, "hey, you just feigned surprise," or "that’s backseat driving," don’t worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on."
